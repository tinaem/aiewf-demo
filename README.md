## 🚀 BRK241: From Prototype to Production — Build and Run Agents at Scale

### Session Description

Taking an AI agent from a working prototype to a reliable, scalable production
service involves real engineering: deployment, tools, memory, long-running work,
human oversight, and observability. This breakout walks that journey using two
sample agents you can run yourself on **Microsoft Foundry**:

- **`field-ops-agent`** — a voice-enabled field technician assistant built on the
  **Microsoft Agent Framework**, showing tools, an MCP **Toolbox** connection, an
  optional **Microsoft Fabric** data agent, and procedural memory.
- **`fibey-coordinator`** — a long-running network operations coordinator that
  monitors telemetry, persists context across sessions, **scales to zero** while
  waiting, gates actions behind **human-in-the-loop** approvals, and can work in
  **Microsoft Teams**.

Both agents deploy with a single `azd` command, emit traces to Application
Insights, and ship with sample tool data so they run end-to-end out of the box.

### 🚀 Getting started

You can deploy both agents to your own Microsoft Foundry project with the Azure
Developer CLI.

**Prerequisites**

- An Azure subscription with access to [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/)
- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) v1.24+
- The Foundry agents extension: `azd extension install azure.ai.agents`
- Python 3.12+

**Clone and deploy**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Build26-BRK241-from-prototype-to-production-build-and-run-agents-at-scale.git
cd Build26-BRK241-from-prototype-to-production-build-and-run-agents-at-scale

# Install the Foundry agents azd extension (first time only)
azd extension install azure.ai.agents

# Log in and select the subscription that will host the project
azd auth login
az login

# Provision the Foundry project, model deployment, ACR, and App Insights
azd provision
```

After provisioning, set your tenant ID so `azd deploy` can complete the agent's RBAC setup:

```bash
# Bash / macOS / Linux
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
azd deploy

# PowerShell (Windows)
$env:AZURE_TENANT_ID = (az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
azd deploy
```

Deploy a single agent with `azd deploy field-ops-agent` or
`azd deploy fibey-coordinator`. Tear everything down with `azd down`.

See [`src/field-ops-agent/`](src/field-ops-agent/README.md) and
[`src/fibey-coordinator/`](src/fibey-coordinator/README.md) for per-agent details,
example prompts, and the optional integrations (Toolbox, Fabric, Teams,
Durable Task Scheduler).

> **Wiring the `supplier_docs` knowledge tool (Foundry IQ):** `azd provision` /
> `azd deploy` create the agents, but the supplier-docs knowledge tool needs a few
> extra steps (embedding model, corpus upload, knowledge source/base, toolbox, a
> role grant, and wiring `TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT` + redeploy). Follow the **End-to-end
> deployment runbook** in
> [`src/field-ops-agent/SETUP-INTEGRATIONS.md`](src/field-ops-agent/SETUP-INTEGRATIONS.md)
> §2 — otherwise the agent answers from its offline mock.

> **Tip:** After `azd deploy` succeeds the output prints an **Agent playground** URL
> for each agent. Open it in the browser to chat with the agent immediately — no
> extra setup needed.

### 🎬 Running the demo

Once deployed, open each agent's playground URL (printed by `azd deploy`) or
retrieve it at any time with:

```bash
azd show
```

#### field-ops-agent — voice-enabled field assistant

Try these prompts in the playground:

```
Hey, can you pull up the fiber termination spec for the Quincy North site
and tell me which panel I should be looking at for the B-side connection?
```

```
What repair procedure should I follow for a QSFP-DD transceiver replacement?
```

```
Any P1 work orders assigned to me?
```

The agent responds with the fast-ack voice pattern: it acknowledges in ~1 s,
then streams the full answer when the background worker finishes.

#### fibey-coordinator — long-running network ops coordinator

```
Check network telemetry for Quincy North - any active alerts?
```

```
Dispatch a work order for the CRC error on Rack B-14
```

```
What active incidents do we have across all sites?
```

```
Escalate the Quincy North optical power issue - SLA at risk
```

Fibey persists investigation context between sessions and can wait (scale-to-zero)
for human approvals via the Durable Task Scheduler.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Build an agent with the **Microsoft Agent Framework** and deploy it to
  **Microsoft Foundry** as a hosted agent using the Azure Developer CLI.
- Extend an agent with tools, **MCP/Toolbox** connections, data agents, and
  procedural memory — and run long-running agents with persistent sessions,
  scale-to-zero, and human-in-the-loop approvals.
- Operate agents in production with built-in **tracing** and **evaluation**.

### 💬 Keep Learning with Copilot

Try these prompts with GitHub Copilot to explore the topics from this session.
Open Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux,
`Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac), paste a prompt, and see what you learn. Connect the
[Microsoft Learn MCP Server](#-microsoft-learn-mcp-server) for the latest official
documentation.

1. Understand the basics:

```
Explain what a hosted agent in Microsoft Foundry Agent Service is and how it differs from running an agent on my own infrastructure.
```

2. Go deeper:

```
Using the Microsoft Learn MCP Server, find the latest documentation on the Microsoft Agent Framework and show me how to define a tool and run an agent loop in Python.
```

3. Build something:

```
Help me create a hosted agent with the Microsoft Agent Framework that exposes one function tool, then deploy it to Microsoft Foundry with the Azure Developer CLI.
```
